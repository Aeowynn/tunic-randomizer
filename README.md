- Extract the zip folder into your game's install directory (Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\TUNIC)
- Launch the game and close it. This will finalize the BepInEx installation.
- Download the TunicRandomizer dll file and copy it into BepInEx/plugins under your game's install directory
- Launch the game again and start a new game!


## Tips
- The following keyboard shortcuts are built-in to the mod:
  - Press '1' to switch between day/night time.
  - Press '2' to display the current seed.
  - Press '3' to display the fox's color palette (important).
  - Press '4' to view how many items have been checked.
- The randomizer has logic to prevent most softlocks, but is not guaranteed to be perfect. If you have checked over 150 of the randomized items, you can press '9' to activate a failsafe which will give you Hyperdash and Grapple, allowing you to access most remaining checks in the game.
- Upon selecting New Game or Continue, a SpoilerLog.json file will be created in the Tunic_Data folder where your game is installed.
